# Backup your ChatGPT conversations

A single client side script to backup your entire conversation history on [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com). The output is a single JSON file of your history.

## 🎯 Choose Your Backup Method

**For backing up individual conversations or custom GPTs**
- Use `backup_conversa_atual.js` 
- ⚡ **Fast**: Takes seconds
- 🎯 **Targeted**: Only current conversation
- 💾 **Lightweight**: Small file size

### Option B: Complete Backup
**For backing up all your ChatGPT history**
- Use `backup.js`
- 🕐 **Comprehensive**: All conversations
- ⏳ **Time-intensive**: Can take hours
- 📦 **Large**: Full history file
